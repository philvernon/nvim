# Neovim configuration

Lua-based Neovim configuration using lazy.nvim, a comma leader, native LSP configuration, automatic formatting and linting, Telescope/Neo-tree/Yazi navigation, Git tooling, DAP and terminal-based AI tooling.

Capitalised terms such as MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT and MAY are normative in the BCP 14 sense.

## Overview

init.lua is deliberately small. It loads core options, bootstraps lazy.nvim, installs global mappings, loads local helpers then configures LSP.

The config is organised around these subsystems:

| Area | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Editor | Relative numbers, system clipboard, persistent undo, two-space indentation, split-below/right |
| Plugin management | lazy.nvim imports every spec under lua/user/plugins |
| Completion | nvim-cmp with LSP, LuaSnip, buffer and path sources |
| LSP | Native vim.lsp.config/vim.lsp.enable with Mason-managed servers |
| Formatting | Conform formats on write then falls back to LSP formatting |
| Linting | nvim-lint runs eslint_d for JavaScript, TypeScript and Vue |
| Search | Telescope handles files, grep, buffers, Git state and diagnostics |
| Files | Neo-tree provides an in-Neovim explorer; Yazi provides an external file manager |
| Git | Gitsigns, Neogit, Diffview, CodeDiff and Gitlinker |
| Debugging | nvim-dap, mason-nvim-dap and nvim-dap-ui |
| UI | Catppuccin Mocha, Lualine, WhichKey, hlchunk and Outline |
| Notes/Markdown | render-markdown, bullets.vim, mkdnflow and zk |
| AI/CLI | Sidekick, pi-nvim and Neocrush |

## Configuration layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| init.lua | Top-level load order |
| lua/user/options.lua | Core Vim options and leader |
| lua/user/plugins-lazy.lua | lazy.nvim bootstrap and plugin import |
| lua/user/plugins/ | Plugin specs and plugin-specific configuration |
| lua/user/keymaps.lua | General repository-defined keymaps |
| lua/user/lsp/ | LSP servers, Vue/TypeScript integration, Rust settings and LSP mappings |
| lua/extra.lua | Translate command and Godot project server bootstrap |
| after/ftplugin/ | Filetype-specific behaviour |
| lazy-lock.json | Pinned plugin revisions |
| utils/ | Local helper files, including Sidekick tmux integration |

New plugin configuration SHOULD live under lua/user/plugins. Cross-plugin editor behaviour SHOULD live in lua/user/keymaps.lua or lua/user/lsp. Filetype-specific behaviour SHOULD live under after/ftplugin.

The commented user.godot-setup require in init.lua is not active and MUST NOT be assumed to run.

## Conventions

- The global and local leader MUST be comma (,).
- New custom mappings MUST NOT use backslash as a leader-like prefix.
- Repository-defined mappings SHOULD include a concise desc, preferably one or two words.
- Related leader mappings SHOULD use stable namespaces: f for find, b for buffers, t for tabs, g for code/Git, d for diagnostics and D for debugging.
- Plugin specs SHOULD remain declarative where practical.
- lazy-lock.json SHOULD be updated through lazy.nvim rather than edited manually.
- External commands introduced by the config SHOULD be documented in [External requirements](#external-requirements).
- Secrets and machine credentials MUST NOT be committed to this configuration.
- This keymap inventory MUST cover mappings explicitly defined by this repository. Plugin defaults MAY add mappings at runtime and are outside this inventory.

## Core behaviour

options.lua enables termguicolors, absolute and relative line numbers, smart case-sensitive search, persistent undo, cursorline, a permanent sign column, mouse support and the unnamedplus clipboard. Splits open below and to the right. Indentation uses two columns with expandtab enabled. The statusline is global.

Project-local configuration MAY be loaded through exrc, with secure enabled.

Markdown buffers set textwidth=80 and enable en_GB spelling.

extra.lua defines :Translate using the trans executable. It also detects project.godot in the current directory or its parent and starts a Neovim server at server.pipe when needed. The gdscript ftplugin connects Neovim's LSP client to Godot on GDScript_Port or port 6005.

## Language tooling

Mason-lspconfig ensures vue_ls, ts_ls, lua_ls, bashls, gopls and marksman are installed.

The configuration enables or configures:

| Server | Use |
| --- | --- |
| vtsls | JavaScript, TypeScript and Vue TypeScript support |
| vue_ls | Vue language support |
| yamlls | YAML |
| eslint | ESLint with LspEslintFixAll before writes |
| lua_ls | Lua/Neovim |
| marksman | Markdown |
| gopls | Go |
| bashls | Shell |
| html | HTML |
| cssls | CSS |
| sqls | SQL |
| efm | Enabled if available |
| jsonls | JSON |
| rustaceanvim | Rust tooling outside the generic LSP setup |

Vue uses the TypeScript plugin supplied by vue-language-server. vtsls and vue_ls are enabled together.

Conform MUST run first on BufWritePre. If Conform reports that it could not format, the config falls back to an attached LSP client that supports formatting.

| Filetype | Formatter order |
| --- | --- |
| Lua | stylua |
| Python | isort, black |
| JavaScript | prettierd, prettier |
| TypeScript | prettierd, prettier |
| Vue | prettierd, prettier |
| SCSS | prettierd, prettier |
| Rust | rustfmt |
| Go | goimports, gofumpt |
| HTML | prettierd |
| SQL | pg_format |

nvim-lint runs eslint_d for JavaScript, TypeScript and Vue on buffer entry, after writes, after leaving insert mode and after text changes.

nvim-cmp combines LSP, LuaSnip, buffer and path completion. LuaSnip loads friendly-snippets and adds Vue translation snippets.

The Rust ftplugin also runs the same uppercase-rename code action automatically before writing a Rust buffer.

## External requirements

The configuration MAY start without every external tool installed, but the corresponding feature will not work.

| Tool | Used by |
| --- | --- |
| git | lazy.nvim bootstrap, Git plugins |
| trans | :Translate |
| yazi | yazi.nvim |
| tmux | Sidekick mux |
| pi | Sidekick Pi CLI |
| crush | Neocrush |
| node | JavaScript DAP adapters and several language tools |
| stylua | Lua formatting |
| isort, black | Python formatting |
| prettierd or prettier | JS/TS/Vue/SCSS formatting |
| rustfmt | Rust formatting |
| goimports, gofumpt | Go formatting |
| pg_format | SQL formatting |
| eslint_d | JS/TS/Vue linting |
| Godot | GDScript LSP connection |

Neovim MUST provide the vim.lsp.config and vim.lsp.enable APIs used by this configuration.

## Known caveats

- tg calls :BufferLinePick, but no BufferLine plugin is declared in the current plugin specs. This mapping MAY fail unless that command is supplied elsewhere.
- ,dd calls toggle_diagnostic(), but no definition for that function exists in this repository. This mapping MAY error.
- ,gf filters formatting to an LSP client named null-ls, but null-ls is not declared as a plugin. This mapping MAY do nothing.
- mason-lspconfig ensures ts_ls, while the Vue setup enables vtsls and vue_ls. vtsls MUST therefore be available by some other installation path if it is not managed by Mason here.
- nvim-ufo is declared both in its dedicated plugin file and in all.lua. The duplicate spec SHOULD be consolidated if the configuration is cleaned up.
- Comment.nvim is explicitly disabled while mini.comment is active. Its disabled dependency SHOULD NOT be treated as runtime functionality.
- nvim-treesitter is present only as commented configuration. Other plugins MAY still use Neovim's built-in Tree-sitter facilities or installed parsers.
